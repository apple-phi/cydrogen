Given large yearly budget of 1M EUR (implying that implementation costs are negligible),
the optimal budget allocation ratio PV : Battery : Electrolyser : H2 Fueling Station
is 64.52% : 24.40% : 10.69% : 0.39%.

This follows the intuition that components with lower efficiency higher energy wastage need more investment to transmit the same quantity of energy.

The minimum yearly budget to support a single HEV is Â£100k, split in the PV : Battery : Electrolyser : H2 Fueling Station ratio:
13647, 14000, 240065, 49981
This is a very different ratio to the allocation ratio for a large budget because the effects of installation costs are more pronounced.

If we compare to a the minimum yearly budget to support 1000 HEVs, the ratio is:
