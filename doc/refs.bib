    abstract = {In this work, a comprehensive design and operation optimisation framework is adopted to support short- and long-term technology investment and operation decisions for integrated energy generation, conversion and storage in buildings. The optimisation model accounts for interdependencies between electricity, heat, cold and hydrogen vectors, providing opportunities for smart control and cross-vector flexibility. Potential interactions and synergies between short- and long-term energy storage are investigated and the optimisation model is used to obtain the best possible technology mix and operation strategies within a given time horizon. By solving the model for different combinations of technologies, several economic and environmental benefits of using holistic multi-energy-vector approaches to model energy systems are demonstrated. Systems under consideration include: (i) a PV-electric heat pump-battery system; (ii) a PV-electric heat pump-battery-thermal energy storage system; (iii) a PV-electrolyser-hydrogen storage-fuel cell system; and (iv) a system with all above technology options. Using a university building as a case study, it is shown that the latter system, which involves integrated electricity, heating, cooling and hydrogen generation as well as storage technologies, results to a total system cost and a self-sufficiency that are at least 20\% lower and 30\% higher than the other systems, respectively. Results are useful for end-users, investment decision makers and technology operators when selecting and operating building-integrated energy generation, conversion and storage technologies.},
